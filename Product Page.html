				<p><h2>Introduction</h2><img src="kaby lake.jpg"></p>

				<p>
					Kaby Lake is the codename used by Intel for a processor microarchitecture which was announced on August 30, 2016. Like the preceding Skylake, Kaby Lake is produced using a 14 nanometer manufacturing process technology. Breaking with Intel's previous "tick-tock" manufacturing and design model, Kaby Lake represents the optimized step of the newer process-architecture-optimization" model. Kaby Lake began shipping to manufacturers and OEMs in the second quarter of 2016, and mobile chips have started shipping while Kaby Lake (desktop) chips were officially launched on January 3, 2017. Skylake was anticipated to be succeeded by the 10 nanometer Cannonlake, but it was announced on July 16, 2015, that Cannonlake has been delayed until the second half of 2017. Kaby Lake is the first Intel platform to lack official driver support for versions of Windows older than Windows 10. Built on an improved 14 nm process (14FF+), Kaby Lake features faster CPU clock speeds, clock speed changes, and higher Turbo frequencies. Beyond these process and clock speed changes, little of the CPU architecture has changed from Skylake, resulting in identical IPC (Instructions Per Clock). Kaby Lake features a new graphics architecture to improve performance in 3D graphics and 4K video playback. It will add native HDCP 2.2 support, along with fixed function decode of H.264, HEVC Main and Main10/10-bit, and VP9 10-bit and 8-bit video. Hardware encode is supported for H.264, HEVC Main10/10-bit, and VP9 8-bit video. VP9 10-bit encode is not supported in hardware. Kaby Lake is the first Core architecture to support HyperThreading for the Pentium-branded desktop CPU SKU. Kaby Lake also features the first overclocking-enabled i3-branded CPU.

				<p><h3>Core i3 Processors</h3><img src="i3.jpg"></p>

				<p>
					Developed and manufactured by Intel, the Core i3 is a dual-core computer processor, available for use in both desktop and laptop computers. It is one of three types of processors in the "i" series (also called the Intel Core family of processors). The Core i3 processor is available in multiple speeds, ranging from 1.30 GHz up to 3.50 GHz, and features either 3MB or 4MB of cache. It utilizes either the LGA 1150 or LGA 1155 socket on a motherboard. The most common type of RAM used with a Core i3 processor is DDR3 1333 or DDR3 1600. 
					Power usage varies for the Core i3 processors:
					Slower speeds (1.30 GHz to 1.80 GHz) use 11.5 W, 15 W or 25 W of power
					Medium speeds (2.00 GHz to 2.50 GHz) use 28 W, 35 W or 37 W of power
					Faster speeds (2.90 GHz to 3.50 GHz) use 35 W, 37 W or 54 W of power
					Core i3 processors are often used in laptop computers, due to their lower heat generation and conservative battery usage. Some laptops can be used for up to five or six hours on a single battery charge when running a Core i3 processor.

				<p><h3>Core i5 Processors</h3><img src="i5.jpg"></p>

				<p>
					Developed and manufactured by Intel, the Core i5 is a computer processor, available as dual-core or quad-core. It can be used in both desktop and laptop computers, and is one of three types of processors in the "i" series (also called the Intel Core family of processors). The Core i5 processor is available in multiple speeds, ranging from 1.90 GHz up to 3.80 GHz, and it features 3MB, 4MB or 6MB of cache. It utilizes either the LGA 1150 or LGA 1155 socket on a motherboard. The most common type of RAM used with a Core i5 processor is DDR3 1333 or DDR3 1600, however, higher performance RAM can be used as well (if the motherboard supports it).
					Power usage varies for the Core i5 processors:
					Slower speeds (1.90 GHz to 2.30 GHz) use 11.5 W of power
					Medium speeds (2.60 GHz to 3.10 GHz) use 15 W, 25 W, 28 W or 37 W of power
					Faster speeds (3.20 GHz to 3.80 GHz) use 35 W, 37 W, 45 W, 47 W, 65 W or 84 W of power
					Core i5 processors are commonly found in desktop computers for most everyday use and some higher performance needs. Some laptop computers feature Core i5 processors as well, to provide improved performance for heavier usage needs. At the lower speeds, battery usage is pretty conservative and can reach up to five hours or usage on a single charge. However, at higher speeds, battery usage is higher and may result in up to three hours or so of usage per charge.

				<p><h3></a>Core i7 Processors</h3><img src="i7.jpg"></p>

				<p>
					The Intel i7 processor is Intel's top end processor, with several variations available. The i7 processor is available for both desktop computers and laptop computers, available in many different gigahertz speeds and several socket types. There have also been several generations of the i7 processor released as well. Whatever the needs of the user are, an i7 processor is available to meet those needs. The i7 processor is a popular choice in the consumer and business market for a wide range of uses and are available in speeds as low as 1.07 GHz and as high as 3.6 GHz. The first i7 processor was released in November 2008, and since then, there have been over 60 versions released for desktop and laptop computers. The i7 ranges from 4-10 cores based on the model. Benchmark tests done on the i7 processor produce some of the best marks and ratings in the industry.
